# AI-Checkers
This project involves on creating an algorithm that aids a robot to play checkers against a human. The objective was for the robot moves to be performed in the robot itself,
however, pandemic didn't allow me to enter the university labs. Thus, all movements and plays are simulated and shown in the python console.
Python 'BaxterUICheckers' script is used as the robot's decision algorithm and board updater.
Python 'BaxterDo_Dummy' script is used to simulate the robot movements in real life.
